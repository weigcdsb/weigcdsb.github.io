Hey, this is Ganchao Wei (魏赣超 in Chinese), a [postdoctoral associate](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/ganchao.wei) working at [Duke Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/). As a statistician transitioning from the biological sciences, I primarily focus on developing machine learning (AI) and statistical methods for complex biological data (e.g., neural and microbiome data). Depending on the scientific questions and data structures, my current interests include generative models, normalizing flows, Bayesian statistics, latent variable modeling, and spatiotemporal analysis for high-dimensional data.
