Hey, this is Ganchao Wei (魏赣超 in Chinese), a postdoctoral statistician/ML researcher working at [Duke (stats -> neuro)](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/ganchao.wei). Previously played a lot with Bayesian and computational neuro stuff (still at it), but recently diving into deep generative models, especially diffusion stuff, brings me a lot of joy. Check out my [blogs](https://weigcdsb.github.io/blogs/) for latest reads and random thoughts. Keep exploring, yay!
